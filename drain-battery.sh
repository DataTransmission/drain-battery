#---------DESCRIPTION--------
	# A script that is useful for automating the draining of computer batteries to 50% for storing over long periods of time
	# This was originally used in an educational setting for discharging laptops while they were not being used over the summer

#-----------USAGE------------
	# To run: 
	#
	# 	0. Set the desired battery percentage in the variable below	 
	#	1. Run locally: ./Battery-Drain-to-50-Percent.sh
	#	2. Run remotely: Execute from Casper Remote or ARD

#----------VARIABLES---------			
	# Change this to the percent you want the battery drained to--whole integers only
	# Default is 50%
	desiredPercentage="50"

#----------FUNCTIONS---------
